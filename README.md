This project was created in order to run a Tooling Storage from a particular company Production Line.
The project keeps track of all the tools that are given to employees throughout the day and then returned once they're done with them. 
In order to keep the process as fluid as possible, barcode scanners are to be used by the person that works at the Tooling Storage. 

Theory of Operation:
Employee needs tool, TS worker scans the employee badge then scans the tool. System then considers the tool as lent to that particular employee.
Whenever the employee returns with the tool, the whole process happens again except that this time the tool receives a status as "Returned"

A dashboard and tool search is available for regular users, edit section (to add tools, declare tools as lost/damaged) available only for TS employee.
